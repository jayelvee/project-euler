/* The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385 
The square of the sum of the first ten
natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025 

Hence the difference between the sum
of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the
sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum. */
